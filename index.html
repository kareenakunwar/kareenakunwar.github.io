        <h1>Superstore Data Analysis</h1>
        <p>This analysis provides insights into sales performance and trends from the Superstore dataset using Tableau
            visualizations.</p>

        <!-- Section 1: Sales Distribution -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>1. Sales Distribution Across States</h2>
            <img src="sales.png" alt="Sales Distribution Across States">
            <p>
                <strong>Top 3 States:</strong> California, New York, Texas<br>
                <strong>Bottom 3 States:</strong> Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Insights:</strong>
                The sales distribution reveals significant concentration in urbanized and populous states like
                California, New York, and Texas. These states have robust economies and higher customer demand.
                Conversely, sparsely populated states like Wyoming and North Dakota have the lowest sales, reflecting
                limited market size and customer reach.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Section 2: Category Sales Comparison -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>2. Category Sales Comparison</h2>
            <img src="categorysales.png" alt="Category Sales Comparison">
            <p>
                <strong>Highest Sales Category:</strong> Technology<br>
                <strong>Lowest Sales Category:</strong> Furniture
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Insights:</strong>
                The Technology category outperforms others due to high consumer demand for electronics and gadgets. In
                contrast, the Furniture category has the lowest sales, likely because of higher costs, longer purchase
                cycles, or space constraints among customers.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Section 3: Monthly Sales Trend -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>3. Monthly Sales Trend</h2>
            <img src="monthlysales.png" alt="Monthly Sales Trend">
            <p>
                <strong>Insights:</strong>
                The sales trend demonstrates a consistent spike in December, indicating strong holiday season shopping.
                Sales drop in January and February, reflecting the post-holiday slump.
                Mid-year months (June and July) show steady performance, potentially driven by mid-year campaigns or
                specific seasonal needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                These patterns suggest that promotional efforts should be intensified during peak months, while slower
                periods could be used to introduce discounts or clearance sales.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Section 4: Profit vs. Sales Analysis -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>4. Profit vs. Sales Analysis</h2>
            <img src="profilevssales.png" alt="Profit vs. Sales Analysis">
            <p>
                <strong>Insights:</strong>
                The scatter plot highlights the relationship between sales and profit across sub-categories:
            <ul>
                <li>Sub-categories like <strong>Tables</strong> and <strong>Bookcases</strong> show high sales but
                    minimal or negative profit margins, possibly due to high production costs or excessive discounts.
                </li>
                <li>Sub-categories such as <strong>Phones</strong> and <strong>Copiers</strong> have both high sales and
                    profit, indicating strong market demand and efficient cost management.</li>
                <li>Low-profit sub-categories could benefit from revisiting pricing strategies or reducing costs to
                    improve profitability.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Section 5: Sales by Shipping Mode -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>5. Sales by Shipping Mode</h2>
            <img src="salesbyshipping.png" alt="Sales by Shipping Mode">
            <p>
                <strong>Highest Sales Mode:</strong> Standard Class<br>
                <strong>Lowest Sales Mode:</strong> Same Day
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Insights:</strong>
                Standard Class dominates sales, reflecting its affordability and popularity among customers.
                Same Day shipping has the lowest sales due to higher costs, limiting its appeal to time-sensitive
                customers only.
                These findings suggest focusing on optimizing Standard Class logistics while exploring ways to make Same
                Day shipping more cost-effective.
