        <h2>Key Insights</h2>
        <h3>1. Testing and Cases</h3>
        <p>Testing volumes increased significantly in 2021 compared to 2020, enabling better tracking and pandemic management. Regions with higher testing rates demonstrated lower case fatality rates, emphasizing the importance of widespread testing.</p>

        <h3>2. Vaccination Progress</h3>
        <p>Higher vaccination rates correlate with reduced mortality rates, highlighting the effectiveness of vaccines in mitigating severe outcomes and controlling the spread of the virus.</p>

        <h3>3. Healthcare Strain</h3>
        <p>A strong relationship between ICU cases and deaths underscores the critical role of healthcare infrastructure. Countries with robust ICU and hospital facilities managed to reduce mortality rates despite high infection counts.</p>

        <h3>4. Regional Disparities</h3>
        <p>Geographic and economic disparities significantly influenced outcomes. Wealthier regions with better healthcare systems and higher vaccination coverage reported fewer deaths per million compared to under-resourced regions.</p>

        <h3>5. Continental Trends</h3>
        <p>Asia and Europe reported the highest case numbers, but Africa, despite having fewer cases, faced challenges due to limited healthcare resources. This disparity highlights global inequalities in pandemic response.</p>
